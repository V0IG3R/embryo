# AI Startup Assistant - Backend

This FastAPI backend uses a Groqâ€‘powered LLM to validate business ideas, generate investor pitches, create reminders, build startup roadmaps, generate marketing content, and (new!) support voice-enabled pitch practice. The Pitch Practice feature uses Vosk for speech-to-text and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech.
